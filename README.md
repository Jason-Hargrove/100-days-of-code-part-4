# Day 3 of My 100 Days of Code: Venturing into AI with JavaScript

## Today's Progress

I started by generating an API key and setting up a language model to begin crafting AI-driven interactions. I wrote functions to handle AI responses and set up a GitHub repository to track my project. However, I encountered some hurdles with API key permissions and billing issues, which I managed to resolve after some troubleshooting.

I experimented with streams and creating dynamic prompts, and spent some time refactoring my functions to make them cleaner and more efficient. Additionally, I set up templates and customized questions to make the AI interactions more engaging and user-specific.

## Thoughts

Working through the API key and billing challenges was a bit tricky.

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow, I'll start incorporating external APIs into my project to enhance the functionality and responsiveness of the AI.

# Day 2 of My 100 Days of Code: Venturing into AI with JavaScript

## Introduction

Diving into "AI Programming for JavaScript Developers" on LinkedIn Learning.

## Today's Progress

I began by exploring AI in the JavaScript ecosystem, understanding how JavaScript developers can leverage AI technologies. I set up my development environment, installed the OpenAI library.

## Thoughts

The setup went smoothly. Tomorrow, I'll add my API key and begin interacting with AI models directly from my code.

# Day 1 of My 100 Days of Code: Kicking Off with Vue.js, Axios, and GitHub Pages!

## Introduction

Today marks the first day of my 100 Days of Code challenge! I'm excited to sharpen my skills in web development. With this project I focused on Vue.js, Axios for API handling, and deployed to GitHub Pages. My journey began when a friend needing help with his computer science homework, and wanted to introduce him to peer programming.

## Today's Progress

I initiated a Vue.js project where my main task was to integrate Axios to fetch JSON data. I successfully pulled in a dataset and implemented filtering logic to manage the data displayed in a user-friendly table format. This involved configuring Bootstrap for the UI to ensure the application looks appealing.

## Thoughts

Working through the initial configurations and integrations posed a good challenge, particularly around handling asynchronous data fetching and rendering it effectively. Overcoming these challenges with Axios and Vue.js filters boosted my confidence and deepened my understanding of frontend development.
