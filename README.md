# Day 10 of 100 Days of Code: Python Functions and Control Flow

## Today's Progress

Defining functions in Python, using them to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. Conditional logic, employing if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of my programs. The match-case statement proved invaluable for comparing multiple values easily. I also practiced loops—using while and for loops to iterate over data, incorporating break and continue to fine-tune loop execution, and utilizing the enumerate() function to access index during loops. Additionally, I began working with classes and handling exceptions to manage errors more gracefully.

In today's coding challenge, I tackled creating a function to determine if a string is a palindrome, reinforcing my function writing skills and understanding of Python's string manipulation capabilities.

## Thoughts

Each new Python feature I learn opens up more possibilities for solving problems efficiently and creatively.

# Day 8 of 100 Days of Code: Brushing up on Python

## Today's Progress

Installed latest version of Python and configuring my environment. Solved conflicts in my .zshrc file due to the updated version of Python.

After ensuring everything was set up correctly, I dived into a LinkedIn Learning course on Python. I cloned the course repository and successfully built a small "Hello World" app, marking my first Python project on this new setup.

## Thoughts

Navigating through system configurations and setting up a new programming language was challenging. It's exciting to get back int Python.

# Day 7 of 100 Days of Code: Building an Interactive Assistant in Node.js

## Today's Progress

Created an assistant within my Node app, added threads to capture user input, parsing the assistant response, and LangChain.

## Thoughts

Each step forward in this project opens up new possibilities for creating more intuitive and responsive user interactions.

### Day 5: May 1, 2024

# Day 5 of 100 Days of Code: Using AI and Node to Transcribe Audio

## Today's Progress

Today was all about setting up a backend using Node.js. I installed essential packages like dotenv for managing environment variables, axios for making HTTP requests, and form-data for handling form submissions. I also created an .env file to securely store my API key, transitioning from inputting it directly in the terminal—a practice I'm accustomed to and find secure.

The journey wasn’t without its hurdles; I spent a significant portion troubleshooting. At the end, I discovered a couple of bugs—one due to a misspelled variable and another from using the incorrect built-in function.

## Thoughts

The process of debugging and troubleshooting is often more time-consuming than writing the code itself, but it is just as crucial for the development process. Today's session reinforced the importance of attention to detail and the value of a good debugging strategy.

### Day 4: Apr 30, 2024

# Day 4 of My 100 Days of Code: Venturing into AI with JavaScript

## Today's Progress

Incorporating external APIs, allowing my application to interact dynamically with other services. I implemented a feature using 'readline' to accept user inputs, which has made the interaction more engaging.

One of the highlights of today was creating a function that generates descriptions for images based on their URLs — a fantastic way to merge vision and language models. Additionally, I ventured into audio by recording an MP3 file and successfully transcribing the audio using OpenAI's capabilities through a curl request, demonstrating the versatility of AI in handling various media types.

## Thoughts

Today seemed pretty easy, but long. The ability to transcribe audio and describe images has opened up new possibilities for feature development in my project.

### Day 3: Apr 29, 2024

# Day 3 of My 100 Days of Code: Venturing into AI with JavaScript

## Today's Progress

I started by generating an API key and setting up a language model to begin crafting AI-driven interactions. I wrote functions to handle AI responses and set up a GitHub repository to track my project. However, I encountered some hurdles with API key permissions and billing issues, which I managed to resolve after some troubleshooting.

I experimented with streams and creating dynamic prompts, and spent some time refactoring my functions to make them cleaner and more efficient. Additionally, I set up templates and customized questions to make the AI interactions more engaging and user-specific.

## Thoughts

Working through the API key and billing challenges was a bit tricky.

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow, I'll start incorporating external APIs into my project to enhance the functionality and responsiveness of the AI.

# Day 2 of My 100 Days of Code: Venturing into AI with JavaScript

## Introduction

Diving into "AI Programming for JavaScript Developers" on LinkedIn Learning.

## Today's Progress

I began by exploring AI in the JavaScript ecosystem, understanding how JavaScript developers can leverage AI technologies. I set up my development environment, installed the OpenAI library.

## Thoughts

The setup went smoothly. Tomorrow, I'll add my API key and begin interacting with AI models directly from my code.

### Day 1: Apr 27, 2024

# Day 1 of My 100 Days of Code: Kicking Off with Vue.js, Axios, and GitHub Pages!

## Introduction

Today marks the first day of my 100 Days of Code challenge! I'm excited to sharpen my skills in web development. With this project I focused on Vue.js, Axios for API handling, and deployed to GitHub Pages. My journey began when a friend needing help with his computer science homework, and wanted to introduce him to peer programming.

## Today's Progress

I initiated a Vue.js project where my main task was to integrate Axios to fetch JSON data. I successfully pulled in a dataset and implemented filtering logic to manage the data displayed in a user-friendly table format. This involved configuring Bootstrap for the UI to ensure the application looks appealing.

## Thoughts

Working through the initial configurations and integrations posed a good challenge, particularly around handling asynchronous data fetching and rendering it effectively. Overcoming these challenges with Axios and Vue.js filters boosted my confidence and deepened my understanding of frontend development.
