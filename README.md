# Day 18 of 100 Days of Code: Python Date and Time Code Challenge and Quiz

## Today's Progress

Python coding challenge that involved working extensively with dates and times using the calendar module.

Count the occurrences of a specific day of the week within a given month and year. I wrote a function count_days that efficiently calculates how often each day appears, such as how many Mondays are in December 2025. Additionally, I enhanced my understanding of Python’s date module by writing a script to predict tomorrow’s day of the week.

Following the coding session, I completed a chapter quiz that tested my knowledge on handling dates and times in Python, reinforcing the concepts I practiced in the challenge.

## Thoughts

Got sidetracked a bit with some of the questions, but learned a lot.

## Code

```python
import calendar
from datetime import date

def count_days(year, month, whichday):
    # Generate the calendar for the month
    cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)
    day_count = 0

    # Count occurrences of the specific day of the week
    for week in cal:
        if week[whichday] != 0: # The day of the week is in this week
            day_count += 1

    return day_count

print(count_days(2025, 12, 0))
# Wxpected result: 5

# Day 1 of My 100 Days of Code: Kicking Off with Vue.js, Axios, and GitHub Pages!

## Introduction

Today marks the first day of my 100 Days of Code challenge! I'm excited to sharpen my skills in web development. With this project I focused on Vue.js, Axios for API handling, and deployed to GitHub Pages. My journey began when a friend needing help with his computer science homework, and wanted to introduce him to peer programming.

## Today's Progress

I initiated a Vue.js project where my main task was to integrate Axios to fetch JSON data. I successfully pulled in a dataset and implemented filtering logic to manage the data displayed in a user-friendly table format. This involved configuring Bootstrap for the UI to ensure the application looks appealing.

## Thoughts

Working through the initial configurations and integrations posed a good challenge, particularly around handling asynchronous data fetching and rendering it effectively. Overcoming these challenges with Axios and Vue.js filters boosted my confidence and deepened my understanding of frontend development.
