# Day 19 of 100 Days of Code: Python Data Handling, Parsing, and More

## Today's Progress

Finished "Learning Python" on LinkedIn Learning. Today I worked with internet data handling capabilities.

I began by fetching data from the internet using urllib.request and explored JSON data manipulation to enhance my ability to process and interpret web data dynamically. I also tackled SSL issues, ensuring secure data transactions.

Additionally, I practiced parsing and processing HTML with Python's html.parser module, gaining a better understanding of web content manipulation. I then moved on to manipulating XML, learning to parse, modify, and create XML elements which are crucial for managing structured data.

## Thoughts

Feels good to have this course behind me - on to the next!

# Day 18 of 100 Days of Code: Python Date and Time Code Challenge and Quiz

## Today's Progress

Python coding challenge that involved working extensively with dates and times using the calendar module.

Count the occurrences of a specific day of the week within a given month and year. I wrote a function count_days that efficiently calculates how often each day appears, such as how many Mondays are in December 2025. Additionally, I enhanced my understanding of Python’s date module by writing a script to predict tomorrow’s day of the week.

Following the coding session, I completed a chapter quiz that tested my knowledge on handling dates and times in Python, reinforcing the concepts I practiced in the challenge.

## Thoughts

Got sidetracked a bit with some of the questions, but learned a lot.

## Code

```python
import calendar
from datetime import date

def count_days(year, month, whichday):
    # Generate the calendar for the month
    cal = calendar.monthcalendar(year, month)
    day_count = 0

    # Count occurrences of the specific day of the week
    for week in cal:
        if week[whichday] != 0: # The day of the week is in this week
            day_count += 1

    return day_count

print(count_days(2025, 12, 0))
# Wxpected result: 5
```

# Day 17 of 100 Days of Code: Python's Calendar Module

## Today's Progress

Explored the Python calendar module, for managing and displaying calendars in different formats.

I started by generating plain text calendars, then moved on to creating HTML formatted calendars which can be seamlessly integrated into web applications. I also delved into looping over days of a month to understand how Python handles dates that span multiple months.

Additionally, I utilized the module to find specific days, such as the first Friday of each month for scheduling recurring team meetings. This practical application of the calendar module highlighted its utility in real-world programming scenarios.

## Thoughts

The ability to manipulate and interact with calendar data programmatically opens up numerous possibilities for developing applications that require scheduling and date tracking.

# Day 14 of 100 Days of Code: Exploring Date and Time in Python

## Today's Progress

Handling dates and times using Python’s datetime module.

I started by using the simple today() method from the date class to fetch the current date and then printed out its individual components such as year, month, and day. I also retrieved today’s weekday, understanding Python’s system where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. Additionally, I explored the datetime class to get not only today's date but also the current time.

## Thoughts

It’s incredibly useful to see how Python can manage date and time data.

# Day 10 of 100 Days of Code: Python Functions and Control Flow

## Today's Progress

Defining functions in Python, using them to encapsulate reusable blocks of code. Conditional logic, employing if, elif, and else statements to control the flow of my programs. The match-case statement proved invaluable for comparing multiple values easily. I also practiced loops—using while and for loops to iterate over data, incorporating break and continue to fine-tune loop execution, and utilizing the enumerate() function to access index during loops. Additionally, I began working with classes and handling exceptions to manage errors more gracefully.

In today's coding challenge, I tackled creating a function to determine if a string is a palindrome, reinforcing my function writing skills and understanding of Python's string manipulation capabilities.

## Thoughts

Each new Python feature I learn opens up more possibilities for solving problems efficiently and creatively.

# Day 5 of 100 Days of Code: Using AI and Node to Transcribe Audio

## Today's Progress

Today was all about setting up a backend using Node.js. I installed essential packages like dotenv for managing environment variables, axios for making HTTP requests, and form-data for handling form submissions. I also created an .env file to securely store my API key, transitioning from inputting it directly in the terminal—a practice I'm accustomed to and find secure.

The journey wasn’t without its hurdles; I spent a significant portion troubleshooting. At the end, I discovered a couple of bugs—one due to a misspelled variable and another from using the incorrect built-in function.

## Thoughts

The process of debugging and troubleshooting is often more time-consuming than writing the code itself, but it is just as crucial for the development process. Today's session reinforced the importance of attention to detail and the value of a good debugging strategy.

# Day 4 of My 100 Days of Code: Venturing into AI with JavaScript

## Today's Progress

Incorporating external APIs, allowing my application to interact dynamically with other services. I implemented a feature using 'readline' to accept user inputs, which has made the interaction more engaging.

One of the highlights of today was creating a function that generates descriptions for images based on their URLs — a fantastic way to merge vision and language models. Additionally, I ventured into audio by recording an MP3 file and successfully transcribing the audio using OpenAI's capabilities through a curl request, demonstrating the versatility of AI in handling various media types.

## Thoughts

Today seemed pretty easy, but long. The ability to transcribe audio and describe images has opened up new possibilities for feature development in my project.

### Day 3: Apr 29, 2024

# Day 3 of My 100 Days of Code: Venturing into AI with JavaScript

## Today's Progress

I started by generating an API key and setting up a language model to begin crafting AI-driven interactions. I wrote functions to handle AI responses and set up a GitHub repository to track my project. However, I encountered some hurdles with API key permissions and billing issues, which I managed to resolve after some troubleshooting.

I experimented with streams and creating dynamic prompts, and spent some time refactoring my functions to make them cleaner and more efficient. Additionally, I set up templates and customized questions to make the AI interactions more engaging and user-specific.

## Thoughts

Working through the API key and billing challenges was a bit tricky.

## Looking Ahead

Tomorrow, I'll start incorporating external APIs into my project to enhance the functionality and responsiveness of the AI.

### Day 1: Apr 27, 2024

# Day 1 of My 100 Days of Code: Kicking Off with Vue.js, Axios, and GitHub Pages!

## Introduction

Today marks the first day of my 100 Days of Code challenge! I'm excited to sharpen my skills in web development. With this project I focused on Vue.js, Axios for API handling, and deployed to GitHub Pages. My journey began when a friend needing help with his computer science homework, and wanted to introduce him to peer programming.

## Today's Progress

I initiated a Vue.js project where my main task was to integrate Axios to fetch JSON data. I successfully pulled in a dataset and implemented filtering logic to manage the data displayed in a user-friendly table format. This involved configuring Bootstrap for the UI to ensure the application looks appealing.

## Thoughts

Working through the initial configurations and integrations posed a good challenge, particularly around handling asynchronous data fetching and rendering it effectively. Overcoming these challenges with Axios and Vue.js filters boosted my confidence and deepened my understanding of frontend development.
